# BullsEye

This program will first display a bullseye with a button reading "Animate me" in the middle. Once the button
is clicked, the existing circles inside the bullseye will start to shrink untill their areas equal zero. While
the circles are shrinking, new circles will appear behind the pre-existing circles which are already shrinking
towards zero. The circles which are being made will rotate colors between white and red depending on the pattern
of the bullseye. This will continue untill the user presses stop.

**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT


-Implementation of Timeline in order to have all 7 or 8 circles be created and shrink towards zero and then 
 be created again untill the user stops the animation
